# Joshua J. Yu | Here are my projects!
## Comparison of Regression Models on Predicting Medical Costs
- A machine learning project developed in *UVA CS 4774 Machine Learning* with Professor Nguyen
- I developed a model that takes in historical medical cost data to predict medical insurance costs based on factors such as age, sex, and bmi
- Using Batch Gradient Descent and Normal Equation, we can optimize the linear regression model to perform with mean average error of $33,596,915.85.
